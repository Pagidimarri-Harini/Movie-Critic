# Movie-Critic
In this dataset, you are provided with 7398 movies. Movies are
labeled with id. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords,
budget, posters, release dates, languages, production
companies, and countries.
You are predicting the worldwide revenue for 4398 movies in
the test file.
Note - Many movies are remade over the years, therefore it may
seem like multiple instances of a movie appear in the data,
however they are different and should be considered separate
movies. In addition, some movies may share a title, but be
entirely unrelated.
E.g. The Karate Kid (id: 5266) was released in 1986, while a
remake (id: 1987) was released in 2010.
